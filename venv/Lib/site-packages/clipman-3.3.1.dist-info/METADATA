__Python3 module for working with clipboard. Created because pyperclip is discontinued.__

__Mostly made for [✨ YTCON](https://github.com/NikitaBeloglazov/ytcon)__

# 📘 Features:
* Easy use and simple architecture by KISS
* User-friendly
* No additional modules
* Supports many engines
* We use PyLint and we comment all our code
* Active development
* Just good dev 😇

# 👽 Using
```python3
import clipman
clipman.init() # Just initialize module

# Set text to clipboard
clipman.set("test")

# Get text from clipboard. So simple!:)
print(clipman.get())
Out: 'test'
```
__Also you can use `clipman.copy("ytcon")` and `clipman.paste()` as from pyperclip!:)__
## Catching errors
* If you want to catch all errors from the module, use `clipman.exceptions.ClipmanBaseException`:
```python3
import clipman
try:
  clipman.init()
  print(clipman.paste())
except clipman.exceptions.ClipmanBaseException as e:
  print(e)
```
* And if you want to catch specific module error, use its name.
